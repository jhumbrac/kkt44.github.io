	<h1>GA Web Design Circuit - Challenge 2</h1>

	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>Two websites I am most inspired by are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="www.focusdigital.co.uk" target="_blank">www.focusdigital.co.uk</a></li>
		<li><a href="www.starbucks.co.uk" target="_blank">www.starbucks.co.uk</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p><strong>www.focusdigital.co.uk</strong> - uses vertical grid design. The website uses margins, increased line-height of the text and reduced page weight to create harmony and visual comfort in the design. Headlines carry different weight to the text which creates the hierarchy. As the website is text heavy, designers used bold text to hightlighti mportant information and different colour to highlight calls to action within the text. The website is user friendly with its primary calls to action placed at the top of the page; users can access information they are interested in in any order without having to scroll down.</p>

	<p><strong>www.starbucks.co.uk</strong>- uses horizontal grid design. Large margins create more whitespace and help focus attention on the positive space of the design. Flowlines break the space between different objects and help to guide the eye across the page. To create hierarchy, the front of the text within the grids is different size and calls to action are underlined. Conveniently placed calls to action, at the top of the page, take users to additional content.</p>
