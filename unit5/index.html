		<h1>UNIT 5: - Build your own website: Part 1</h1>
			<p>For the reminder of the course I will be building a wedding website for my friends who are getting married in July 2015.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Step 1: Define your Audience/ Tone</h2>
        <h3><strong>Who will visit your site? Potential employers?</strong></h3>
        	<p>New clients or customers?The website will be visited by family and friends invited to the wedding.</p>
        </h3><strong>What can make you and/or your product stand out against your competitors?</strong></h3>
        	<p>There are no competitors as such - very specific audience with no need for checking out other wedding websites.</P>
        <h3><stong>How would you speak to your clientele if you were communicating in person? How could you translate that style and tone digitally?</strong></h3>
			<p>The purpose of the website is to provide useful information to those attending the wedding, so I will keep it short and to the point. The layout of the website, the ease of navigation and clear structure will translate the style and tonne digitally.</p>
		<h3></strong>What colours represent you or your product?</strong></h3>
			<p>The wedding pallet will include simple colours - white (R= 255, G=255, B=255), black (R=0, G=0, B=0) and red (R=160, G=7, B=33) and different opacities of these colours.</p>
		<img src="images/colours.png" alt="colour palllet">
		<h3><strong>What images illustrate your message?</strong></h3>
			<p>There will be a photo of the couple getting married on the homepage to let visitors know that they are visiting the right website. There will also be images of a wedding venue and a map of how to get there. Other images to be determined during next few weeks.</p>
	</section>

 		<h2>Step 2: Identify Content</h2>
        <h3>What are the three-to-five pages titled?</h3>
   		<h3>What will be the purpose for each?</h3>
		<h3>What should each page contain? Will there be textual content? Or just images?</h3>
			<p><u>Homepage:</u></P>
				<ul><LI>image of the couple</li></ul>
 				<ul><li>navigation bar</li></ul>
        		<ul><li>count down bar</li></ul>
			<p><u>Page 1:</u><p>
				<ul><li>information about the ceremony and reception, where, what time, how to get there, photos</li></ul> 
			<p><u>Page 2:</u></p>
				<ul><li>as the wedding is happening abroad, page 2 will be dedicated to all necessary travel information, accommodation, useful links etc.</li></ul>
			<p>Page 3:</p> 
				<ul><li>wedding party information</li></ul>
			<p><u>Page 4:</u></p>
				<ul><li>contact us page</li></ul>
